# RAD

This program is an interactive numerical analysis code for the study
of linear electroacoustic systems using the T-matrix technique.

Program RAD was written by Michael Lampton as part of a study of
acoustic resonances in transmission-line and bass-reflex loudspeaker
enclosures. It provides examples of techniques that are useful in
interactively modifying parameter arrays, building a system T-matrix,
and displaying the results.

### NOTES

This version of the program is a modified version of the original
code. The main changes relate to RAD's conversion to use Fortran 77.
The use of Holleriths has been eliminated and hopefully improves
clarity for the user.
